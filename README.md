# PowderPal
## Say goodbye to skiing solo.
Our goal is to ensure that Dartmouth students have more enjoyable skiing and snowboarding experiences by enabling them to connect and engage with others who share similar attributes.

PowderPal provides a satisfying and accessible solution for Dartmouth skiers and snowboarders looking to plan outings with others based on their skiing/snowboarding ability, availability, and transportation needs. The platform enablse users to easily find friends with whom to hit the slopes, plan an outing with friends, and communicate with the group before, during, and after their trip.

### Flows Implemented
1. **Onboarding**: Users can register for the app by entering their name, class year, and whether they are a skier or snowboarder. The user is then prompted to write a short bio and enter their skiing preferences: ability, group size, and terrain. Lastly the user can upload a profile picture (the upload feature is not included in this prototype).
2. **Search for Pals**: Users can navigate to the search tab and search for pals by name. The lists starts with "suggested" pals according to preferences, and gets filtered according to what the user types into the search bar.
